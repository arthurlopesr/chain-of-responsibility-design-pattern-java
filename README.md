# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The **Chain of Responsibility** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to send a request to a chain of handlers. Each handler can process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern helps to decouple the sender of the request from its receivers.

## Structure

The structure of the Chain of Responsibility pattern typically includes the following components:

- **Handler**: An interface that declares a method for processing requests and a reference to the next handler.
- **ConcreteHandler**: Implements the Handler interface and defines the logic for processing requests. It may choose to pass the request to the next handler.
- **Client**: Initiates the request and can configure it with the chain of handlers.

## Advantages

- **Decoupling**: The sender of the request does not need to know which object will handle it.
- **Flexibility**: The chain of handlers can be altered at runtime.
- **Simplicity**: The handling logic can be distributed among different handlers.

## Disadvantages

- **Tracking Difficulty**: It can be hard to understand which handler processed the request if the chain is long.
- **Performance Cost**: Passing the request through multiple handlers may add overhead.

## Applications

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is commonly used in situations where multiple handling options are required, such as:

- Event processing in user interface systems.
- Log management, where different log levels can be handled by different handlers.
- Authentication systems, where different authorization policies can be applied.

## Conclusion

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is an effective solution for the problem of decoupling senders and handlers of requests. Its flexibility and ability to keep processing logic separate make it a popular choice in many systems.
